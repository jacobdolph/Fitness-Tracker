## Tech

<b>Built with</b>
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- JavaScript
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- NPM
    * mongojs
    * mongoose
    * morgan


## Features
- A fun piece of this app was building the backend api to utilize CRUD operations in mongoDD. Setting up the workout.js schema for our models to keep our documents stored consistently was a consideration I needed to think about.
- The other cool thing this app does is that as it continues to store data, when we look GET data for our dashboard we will only serve up data from the current week.
### Future Development
- I plan on implementing the use of IndexedDB for offline use that will update the database when back online.
